## JSON-LD Crawl


### JSON-LD Frames
This is a review of the application programming intereface for JSON-LD syntax or [JSON-LD Framing 1.1](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-framing/).  The goal will be to review frames that could be of use in parsing schema.org JSON-LD as being implemented in the [EarthCube CDF Registry Working Group](https://github.com/fils/CDFRegistryWG)


### Hydra
This is a "shallow dive" into the Hydra vocabulary at [http://www.hydra-cg.com/](http://www.hydra-cg.com/).  The main interest in this review is to see how the hydra vocabulary might be used to help guide a web crawler focused on extracting JSON-LD (like schema.org) from a site.


### Build on Existing
(Doug) I'd be interested to see how this could be connected with the code already at [https://github.com/fils/contextBuilder](https://github.com/fils/contextBuilder)
