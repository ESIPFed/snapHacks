## Hydra

### About
This is a "shallow dive" into the Hydra vocabulary at [http://www.hydra-cg.com/](http://www.hydra-cg.com/).  The main interest in this review is to see how the hydra vocabulary might be used to help guide a web crawler focused on extracting JSON-LD (like schema.org) from a site.
