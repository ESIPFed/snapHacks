# snapHacks
This repository is in support of the snaphacks slack channel.  It holds the various topics that gatherings in that channel work on.  A snapHack is some exploratory dive into a technology to assess it suitability for use.  

## About
snapHacks are short hack-a-thons.  The are shallow quick dives into a technology or idea to explore its value for a purpose.  We want these to be spontaneous and as such;

* There is no schedule for these, do you and some other want to do a quick hack? Then schedule it in the slack channel and perhaps others will join.  
* They may last an hour or two or be spread across several various days and a bit of time over those days.  It's whenever a group wants to work.
* We will collect tools here for us to use in hacking
  * ESIP's slack can do video, audio and screen sharing...  it's quck and easy, we recommend it first.  Plus your conversation will be in the snaphack channel for others to see and contribute to.
  * Google Docs is always nice, but try and place final documents in the repo for others to see.  
  * Realtime collaborative coding tools like:  https://kobra.io/#/ Would love to hear about others people like.
* There are no powerpoints....  though you are encouraged to place your notes into the repository.  Just make a new name for your hack following the sh##-name pattern.  Need push access to the repo, just ask.  
* You are free to explore, edit and update/fork anyones repo here.  So please note that directories in this repository are here to be a public resource for anyone.

### [JSON-LD Crawl](./sh01-jsonldCrawl) 
This hack will look at two items.  JSON-LD Frames and the Hydra vocabulary.   The functional goal is to provide a means to crawl JSON-LD documents using a hypermedia guide. We will look at JSON-LD frames.  Frames is a [JSON-LD community report]
(https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-framing/) for an API 
for JSON-LD syntax. 

Additionally we will "shallow dive" into the Hydra vocabulary at [http://www.hydra-cg.com/](http://www.hydra-cg.com/).  The main interest in this review is to see how the hydra vocabulary might be used to help guide a web crawler focused on extracting JSON-LD (like schema.org) from a site.
