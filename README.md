This repository is in support of the snaphacks slack channel.  It holds the various topics that gatherings in that channel work on.  A snapHack is some exploratory dive into a technology to assess it suitability for use.

### [JSON-LD Crawl](./sh01-jsonldCrawl) 
This hack will look at two items.  JSON-LD Frames and the Hydra vocabulary.   The functional goal is to provide a means to crawl JSON-LD documents using a hypermedia guide. We will look at JSON-LD frames.  Frames is a [JSON-LD community report]
(https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-framing/) for an API 
for JSON-LD syntax. 

Additionally we will "shallow dive" into the Hydra vocabulary at [http://www.hydra-cg.com/](http://www.hydra-cg.com/).  The main interest in this review is to see how the hydra vocabulary might be used to help guide a web crawler focused on extracting JSON-LD (like schema.org) from a site.
